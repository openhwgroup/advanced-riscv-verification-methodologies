Notes 32F
--------

Third cut of SystemVerilog functional coverage generated from machine readable form

Still working on some of the items in the coverpoints etc

Done
----
- datasets through the design DONE (toggle, maxvals)
- cross of rounding modes and datasets
	to check that rounding modes have been stimulated
- specific fpu values DONE (fpu vals) - still needs -ve zero? DONE
- Zfinx

Questions
--------
what more coverage is needed
1) hazards
2) 

what else is needed?  
A) still to check that the coverage points are coded correctly in the SystemVerilog  
B)
