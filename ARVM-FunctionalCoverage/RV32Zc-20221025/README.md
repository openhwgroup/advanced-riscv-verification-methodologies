Second cut of SystemVerilog functional coverage generated from machine readable form

Still working on some of the items in the coverpoints etc

Questions
--------
what more coverage is needed

1) cross of rlist and stack adjust - DONE
2) hazards
3) data sets - DONE (toggle, maxvals)
4) interrupt the instructions that do multiple read/writes, e.g.: push/pop, mv
5) 

what else is still needed?
