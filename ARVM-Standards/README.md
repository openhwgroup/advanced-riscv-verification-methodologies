# ARVM-Standards

The ARVM-Standards sub-project is under the OpenHW VTG and part of the Advanced RISC-V Verification Methodology project.

The focus of ARVM-Standards is in defining and implementing evolving interface standards for test bench components to enable better test bench component reuse and potentially stimulate availability of compatible VIPs.

Initial work is centered around: [RISC-V Verification Interface: RVVI](https://github.com/riscv-verification/RVVI).

Latest status report is: [found here](https://github.com/openhwgroup/programs/blob/master/TGs/verification-task-group/projects/ARVM-Standards/meetings).
