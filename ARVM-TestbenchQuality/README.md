# ARVM-TestbenchQuality

The ARVM-TestbenchQuality sub-project is under the OpenHW VTG and part of the Advanced RISC-V Verification Methodology project.

The focus of ARVM-Standards is in developing quality measurement of test benches - so quality of cores can be predicted (for example defining fault models and tests and relating those to TRL levels).

Work is is just starting (Oct 2022) in this project, and we are just arranging the OpenHW discussions.
